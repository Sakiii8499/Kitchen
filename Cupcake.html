    <p>2 tbsp ground flaxseeds, 4 tbsp water, ½ cup vegetable oil, 1 cup castor sugar, 1 cup sliced raspberries, 4 tbsp
        fresh lemon juice, 1½ cup whole milk, 1½ cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp lemon zest, ½ tsp

        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Line a cupcake tray with liners.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine flaxseeds and water. Mix well and allow it to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat oil and sugar until the mixture is pale. Beat in the flaxseed mixture and the lemon
            juice. Whisk in the milk.</li>
        <li>Sift in the all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt into the wet ingredients. Using a spatula, mix the
            batter until it is smooth and lump-free. Mix in the lemon zest and the sliced raspberries.</li>
        <li>Using an ice-cream scoop, transfer the batter into the cupcake cavities, filling almost to the top.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 180 degrees C for 25-30 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool.</li>
