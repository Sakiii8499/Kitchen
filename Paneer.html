    <h1>Paneer</h1>
    <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
    <p>2 litres full-fat milk
        ,2 large lemons juice</p>
    <p id="ingre">Method</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the full-fat milk in a large pan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove it from
            the heat.</li>
        <li>You can now, skim the top of the milk if a thin 'film-like' layer has appeared. If not then add the lemon
            juice (or vinegar if you prefer). </li>
        <li>Pour this mixture through a muslin cloth/ cheesecloth or a nut milk bag into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, it's time to press your paneer cheese. To do this form it in whatever shape you'd prefer ( be it
            rounded, like mine - or more square) and fold the cloth tightly around it then place a heavy object onto the
            paneer to press it.</li>
        <li>The block of paneer is now ready to be refrigerated. Chop it into cubes and place in a large airtight
            container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>If you want to store it for longer then you may be able to within a brine mixture (using some of the
            leftover whey and some salt).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
