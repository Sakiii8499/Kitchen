    <li>Take maida, carom seeds, salt, and oil (or ghee) in a wide-mouthed bowl.</li>
    <li>Mix well and with your fingertips rub the ghee/oil in the flour to get a breadcrumb-like consistency.</li>
    <li>Now, add water in multiple small quantities and knead firm dough (harder than paratha dough).</li>
    <li>Cover it with wet muslin cloth/any cloth and let it set for 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat cooking oil in kadai over medium flame.Add cumin seeds and crackle them.</li>
    <li>Take one dough ball and press it between your palms to flatten it a little. Put it over rolling board and roll
        it out into round shaped puri having approx 5-6 inch diameter.</li>
    <li>Cut with a knife or a pastry cutter through the center of the samosa sheet into two semi-circles.</li>
    <li>When the oil is medium hot, gently slide 3-4 prepared samosa (depending on the size of a pan) in it and quickly
        reduce the flame to low. Serve samosa with chutney.</li>
