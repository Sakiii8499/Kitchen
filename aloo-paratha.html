        , 1 tablespoon coriander leaves
        , salt as required
        , 1 tablespoon ghee
        , 1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder

        <li>Boil the potatoes at least a few hours before you plan to make the parathas and mash them.</li>
        <li>Take them out from the fridge and add chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder, and red
            chilli powder. Mix well so that no lumps remain. </li>
        <li>Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make small-medium
            balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of potato filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making
            the parathas.</li>
        <li>Now roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas.</li>
        <li>Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both the sides with a spoonful of ghee.</li>
        <li>Serve piping hot with chilled yoghurt or pickle.</li>
