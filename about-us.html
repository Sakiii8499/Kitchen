            <p>Welcome to Sakshi's Kitchen, an Indian food blog on simple vegetarian recipes. I am Sakshi Chede
                currently
                living
                in Pulgaon. I am currently pursuing Btech. in Mechanical from Government College of Engineering

            <p>
                Coming from a very traditional Indian family, I learnt cooking food from my sweet mother. I started this
                blog to
                share my recipes that are simple, quick, healthy and
                delicious. I share only recipes that are tried, tasted and cherised by my family. What you see on the
                blog
                is
                what I make for my loved ones. Whether you are a newbie or an experienced cook, I am sure you will find
                exciting
                and practically possible recipes here that will definitely enhance your cooking skills.
