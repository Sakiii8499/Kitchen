        <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
        <p>1/2 cup Raw rice, 1/4 cup Split yellow moong dal (pasi paruppu), 8 Cashew nuts, Salt needed, 1 1/2 tbsp Oil,
            1
            1/2 tbsp Ghee, 1 inch Ginger finely chopped, 1 tsp Cumin seeds (jeeragam), 1 tsp Whole black pepper
            (milagu),
            Curry leaves few</p>
        <p id="ingre">Method</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Dry roast moong dal and rice separately until it is hot to touch. Do not over fry it.</li>
            <li>Fry cashew nuts in a tsp of ghee and keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Mix both rice and dal, wash and pressure cook adding salt, 2 1/2 - 3 cups of water for 4-5 whistles. The
                rice has to be cooked in such a way that it should be mushy.</li>
            <li>Open the cooker, once the pressure subsides. Mash the rice and dal well, when it is hot.</li>
            <li>Heat oil + ghee, add pepper, cumin seeds, saute for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add fried cashew nuts and mix everything well.</li>
            <li>Alternatively you can add rice+dal mix to the seasoning as I have done and mix well on low flame for 2
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve hot with sambar or gothsu or coconut chutney.</li>
