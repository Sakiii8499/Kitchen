    <h1>Custard</h1>
    <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
    <p>2.5 cups milk or almond milk, 5 tablespoons sugar, 3 tablespoons custard powder, 3 tablespoons milk, warm or at
        room temperature, 1.5 to 2 cups chopped fruits</p>
    <p id="ingre">Method</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 2.5 cups milk in a thick bottomed pan or sauce pan and keep it on the stove top.</li>
        <li>Whilst the milk is getting heated, in a small bowl, take 3 tbsp warm milk. Add 3 tbsp custard powder.</li>
        <li>With a whisk stir very well to make a smooth paste without any lumps.</li>
        <li>When the milk has come to a gentle heat, add 5 tbsp sugar. Stir very well so that the sugar dissolves</li>
        <li>Keep the flame on a low and then add the custard paste in parts.</li>
        <li>Keep on stirring often while the custard is cooking, so that lumps are not formed. Cook for about 5 to 6
            minutes on a low flame.</li>
        <li>Once the custard has cooled, add the mixed fruits. Serve fruit custard garnished with some more fruits and
            pomegranate arils.</li>
