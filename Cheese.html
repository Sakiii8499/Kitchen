    <h1>Cheese</h1>
    <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
    <p>1 gallon whole milk, Â¼ cup white or cider vinegar
        , 1 pinch salt</p>
    <p id="ingre">Method</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk into a large pot, and heat until the temperature reaches 195 degrees F (90 degrees C), or
            almost boiling. Stir constantly to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>When the milk reaches the temperature, remove from the heat, and stir in the vinegar. Let stand for 10
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a strainer with cheesecloth, and set over the sink or a large pot or bowl. The milk should separate
            into a white solid part, and a yellowish liquid (whey).</li>
        <li>Stir the salt into the milk, then pour through the cloth-lined strainer. Let the curds continue to drain in
            the strainer for 1 hour. Discard the whey.

        </li>
        <li>After the cheese has finished draining, pat into a ball, and remove from the cheese cloth.</li>
        <li>Wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Fresh cheese will usually last about a
            week.</li>
    </ol>
