    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas Mark 6. Sift the flour and Sugar Free into a mixing bowl. Add diced butter to flour and rub in with fingertips till the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle five tablespoons of chilled water and mix to make a dough without kneading much. Divide the dough into two equal portions and shape each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Roll out one portion on a lightly floured surface to a disc of about twelve inches in diameter. Use this to line a nine-inch pie dish, easing the dough in carefully so that it does not get stretched.</li>
        <li>Trim off the excess dough. Roll out the remaining dough to a rectangle of one-eighth inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut out half inch strips.</li>
        <li>Cover it with dough strips in a crisscross pattern and bake in the preheated oven for forty-five minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool in the dish. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
