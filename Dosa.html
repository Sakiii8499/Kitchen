    <h1>Dosa</h1>
    <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
    <p>2 cup parboiled rice, 1/2 cup urad dal, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup refined oil, 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds, 1/2
        kilograms boiled potato, 2 medium chopped green chilli</p>
    <p id="ingre">Method</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the batter for Masala Dosa, wash and soak the rice (with fenugreek added into it) and urad dal in
            separate containers for approximately 6-8 hours. </li>
        <li>Once the rice and urad dal are soaked well, grind them separately in a mixer using the water in which they
            were soaked, till the mixture reaches a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Mix the batter of both the ingredients in a bigger container and add salt to it. Combine well and allow it
            to ferment overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour water gradually into the mixture and allow the potatoes to simmer for around 4 minutes. When the
            mixture is in semi-thick state, turn off the gas and let it rest for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>When the colour of dosa's edges turns into brown, reduce the flame and sprinkle few drops of oil on the dosa
            sides and put 2 tablespoons of filling.</li>
        <li>Fold the dosa. Serve hot Masala Dosa with
            coconut chutney and sambhar.</li>
