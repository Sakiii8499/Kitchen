    <h1>Yoghurt</h1>
    <p id="ingre">Ingredients</p>
    <p>8 cups milk (1/2 gallon) — whole or 2% are best, 
        1/2 cup commercial yogurt containing active cultures</p>
    <p id="ingre">Method</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>8 cups milk (1/2 gallon) — whole or 2% are best, but skim can also be used
            1/2 cup commercial yogurt containing active cultures</li>
        <li> Stir the milk gently as it heats to make sure the bottom doesn't scorch and the milk doesn't boil over.</li>
        <li>Let the milk cool until it is just warm to the touch, 112°F to 115°F. Stir occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. </li>
        <li>Scoop out about a cup of warm milk into a bowl. Add the yogurt and whisk until smooth and the yogurt is dissolved in the milk.</li>
        <li>While whisking gently, pour the thinned yogurt into the warm milk. This inoculates the milk with the yogurt culture.</li>
        <li>Let the yogurt set for at least 4 hours or as long as overnight.</li>
    </ol>
